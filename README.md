Andrew,

I tried sendy you email at your gordon.edu address, and I'm guessing it didn't get forwarded.  Here's what it said:

Andrew and Jonny,

http://mazevo.co refuses connections, making me suspect the server is in a bad state.  Can you please check on it?

It won't be long until the Tartan staff needs it urgently (I hope!).  So we should all talk about a longer term support plan after it's back up.

Could you email me at russ.tuck@gordon.edu?

Don't merge this, obviously :-)

Thanks.

   Russ
